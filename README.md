# IRCCHATBOX

IRCCHATBOX is a mock IRC-style chat interface built with Vue 3 and Express.js. It simulates a real chat environment for
demo and testing purposes, showing active-looking conversations, DMs, and channel activity — all powered by file-based logs.

## 🚀 Features

- 📚 Channel and DM views with months of simulated message history
- 🧠 AI-generated mock logs to simulate real chat dynamics
- 💬 Live message input (messages append to `.log` files)
- 🧭 Sidebar navigation with unread indicators
- ➕ Create new channels and DMs (persisted as `.log` files)
- 🎯 Channel/DM-specific sidebar filtering
- 🧱 File-based storage
- 📦 Deployable on simple Node environments

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Storage**: Plain `.log` files (JSON-lines format)

## 📄 Log File Format
Each message is stored as a JSON object in a `.log` file:
```json
{"user":"alice","timestamp":"2025-05-14 10:42","text":"Hello world!"}
```

- Channels: `logs/channels/{channelName}.log`
- DMs: `logs/dms/{username}.log`

---

## 📦 Deployment
You can deploy this on any simple Node/VPS server:
```bash
cd client && npm run build
cd ../server && node server.js
```
Then serve `client/dist/` statically or proxy it via Express.

---

## 🧪 Sample Data
To experiment with the interface, you can create your own `.log` files in the
`logs` folders. Each line should contain a JSON object representing a message.
Example:
```json
{"user":"bob","timestamp":"2025-05-14 12:05","text":"Hey there!"}
```
